Evidence in a murder:
* the murder weapon
* a threatening note
* a false alibi
* a witness
* a motive
* a fingerprint
* a bloody item

Clues need to be corroborated to become evidence. For example:
* A weapon is determined to be the murder weapon.
* A fingerprint sample matches a fingerprint at the crime scene
* An alibi is determined to be false
* Character testimony corroborates a motive
* Witness testimony provides a witness
* A handwriting sample matches a threatening note
* A blood sample matches the victim's blood

Least reliable (unlimited amount of red herrings):
* character testimony
* threatening note
* false (or no) alibi

Most reliable (no more than two red herrings):
* witness testimony
* murder weapon
* fingerprint
* bloody item

There might not be any suspects at the beginning of a case. Suspects need to be found.
Ways to find a suspect:
* a business card
* a phone message
* a letter (with an address)
* an email (with an address)
* a background check

How to get leads and clues:
* Search locations
* Interrogate suspects

Leads provide facts. For example, a business card can provide a suspect's name and address.
Clues can become evidence with substantiation.

Turning clues into evidence
* Alibis
	Ask the corroborating suspect for an alibi. A false alibi will not match.
* Weapons
	Analyze to see if it is the murder weapon
* Handwriting samples / Threatening notes
	Analyze to see if they match
* Fingerprint samples / Fingerprint on scene
	Analyze to see if they match
* Motive
	Just ask a suspect
* Bloody item
	Analyze to see if it matches the victim
